# RefactoringProject-OOP
This repository contains two project files: given un-refactored code and modified refactored code. 
Prior to its modification, the program suffered many technical problems. I was tasked with 
refactoring the program and optimizing it to follow the principles of Object-Oriented Programming. 
OOP principles such as abstraction, encapsulation (coupling), polymorphism, and inheritance has 
been implemented.
