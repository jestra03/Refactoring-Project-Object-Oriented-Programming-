# RefactoringProject-OOP
This repository contains two project files: un-refactored code and modified refactored code. 
Prior to its modification, the program suffered many technical problems. I was tasked with 
refactoring the program and optimizing it to follow the principles of Object-Oriented Programming. 
I implemented OOP principles such as abstraction, encapsulation (coupling), polymorphism, and inheritance.
The refactored project also optimizes pathfinding with the A* search algorithm and adds new entities.
